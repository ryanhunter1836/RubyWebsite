        We only ship the full wiper blade assembly so that replacing your wiper blades is quick and easy.  Beware of subscription services that ship just the wiper blade inserts and not the entire assembly.

    <h4>What is the difference between wiper blades and wiper inserts?</h4>

        Wiper inserts are the rubber portion of the wiper blade.  Replacing the insert can be a frustrating task whose grief simply isn't worth the money savings.  
        That is why we only ship the full wiper blade assembly so that replacing your wiper blades is quick and easy.

    <h4>How do I keep my wipers in good, working order?</h4>
    <p>
        If the wipers are in decent physical condition but not cleaning the windshield effectively, clean them.  
        Simply put windshield washer fluid or glass cleaner on a damp sponge or rag and wipe debris off the rubber wiper blades and the windshield where the wiper rests to make sure you have good, 
        clean contact between the rubber and the glass.
