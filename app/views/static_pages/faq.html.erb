    <h5>How do I keep my wipers in good, working order?</h5>
    <p>
        If the wipers are in decent physical condition but not cleaning the windshield effectively, clean them.  
        Simply put windshield washer fluid or glass cleaner on a damp sponge or rag and wipe debris off the rubber wiper blades and the windshield where the wiper rests to make sure you have good, 
        clean contact between the rubber and the glass.
